# Building a new location from scratch 

To load new data for a new location, take a `pelias.json` from a different project and replace the proper sections as detailed below.

To add new Openaddress data, you'll need to [download an OA archive](https://batch.openaddresses.io/data) and parse the individual city .csvs at the top of the archive with `ls us/nc/ | grep .csv | awk 'NF { print "\"us/nc/"$0"\","}'` and replace the current address data in `pelias.json`.

To add a new WhosOnFirst region, use [Spelunker](https://spelunker.whosonfirst.org/) and search for your state, and filter by region. You can put the resulting code into the `importPlace` array inside `pelias.json`.

To change the Tiger statecode, refer to [this page](https://github.com/pelias/interpolation).
